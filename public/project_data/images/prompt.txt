Render the subject using loose, gestural brushstrokes with soft,
semi-transparent layering. Prioritize silhouette, weight, and motion over
precise anatomy or sharp edges. Work in a restrained grayscale or monochrome
palette, allowing tonal variation — not line work — to define form. Let strokes
remain visible and imperfect, with feathered edges and uneven opacity to evoke a
watercolor or ink-wash feel, whilst not being overly blotchy. Aim for an
expressive, minimalist impression that suggests the subject rather than fully
delineating it, favoring mood and presence over detail. Include a small, roughly
drawn shadow of the subject directly below. Compose on a pure white background.
