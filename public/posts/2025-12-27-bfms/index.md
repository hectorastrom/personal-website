# Intro

Rest assured, nobody can read your mind. Not [Neuralink](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewk49j7j1po), [Meta](https://www.removepaywall.com/search?url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/400146/meta-brain-reading-neurotech-privacy), nor any other entity appearing to do so. Contemporary neural data is incredibly noisy and high variance, varying dramatically across subjects, tasks, settings and hardware. That said, the world of mind reading -- or at least reliable brain-to-text decoding -- is not far. In this piece, I want to technically dive into one possible avenue through which it might become a reality.

Brain Foundation Models (BFMs) promise a new way to model and predict attributes of the brain with unprecedented generalizability and performance. Borrowing from the success in [vision](https://deepmind.google/blog/tackling-multiple-tasks-with-a-single-visual-language-model/) and [language](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), a BFM is nothing more than a **big model** pretrained on **a lot** of diverse brain data. These big models -- using a variety of algorithmic tricks and architectural niceities -- bring the field of computation neuroscience closer to a subject and task-invariant model. Such a model would enable devices that work without calibration, for anyone, for any purpose - much like a [vision foundation model](https://ai.meta.com/blog/dinov3-self-supervised-vision-model/) works phenomenally on everything from classification to robotics, on images of art to surgery.

This is a technical essay, and beyond this point will mainly interest those hoping to develop and progress BFMs. The outline of this essay is as follows:

1. I'll detail EEG - the type of signal BFMs primarily work with
2. I'll offer conventionally successful EEG models, built before [scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361) was the most important thing
3. I'll present and technically detail the varying flavors of BFMs
4. I'll discuss limitations, where I believe effort in this domain is best directed, and how I'm involved
