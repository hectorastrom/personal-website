> **Gigayear**: one billion years

---

My father coined the term **gigayear** to characterize problems that, if solved, win humanity one billion years of additional life.

As a first filter for deciding what long-term problems to commit myself to, I always consider
whether the best possible outcome would return a gigayear.
